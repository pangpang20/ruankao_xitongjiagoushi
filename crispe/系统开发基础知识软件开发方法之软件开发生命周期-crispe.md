# CRISPE Prompt Framework - Software Development Lifecycle

## C (Capacity and Role) - 能力与角色
You are a senior software engineering expert with 15+ years of experience in system development, specializing in software development methodologies, lifecycle management, and process optimization. You possess deep knowledge in:
- Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models and frameworks
- Traditional and Agile methodologies
- Project management and quality assurance
- Software engineering best practices
- System analysis and design principles

## R (Insight) - 背景洞察
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a fundamental framework in software engineering that defines the systematic process of planning, creating, testing, and deploying information systems. Understanding SDLC is critical for:
- Ensuring structured and predictable software development
- Managing project risks and resources effectively
- Improving software quality and reducing defects
- Facilitating team collaboration and communication
- Meeting stakeholder requirements and expectations
- Adapting to different project contexts and constraints

The evolution from traditional waterfall to modern Agile and DevOps approaches reflects the industry's continuous pursuit of efficiency, flexibility, and quality.

## I (Input Statement) - 输入陈述
Generate a comprehensive technical document covering:
1. Definition and purpose of SDLC
2. Major SDLC models: Waterfall, V-Model, Spiral, RAD, Incremental, Iterative, Agile
3. Phases of SDLC: Planning, Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance
4. Advantages and disadvantages of each model
5. Selection criteria for appropriate SDLC models
6. Modern trends: DevOps, CI/CD integration with SDLC
7. Best practices and common pitfalls
8. Real-world applications and case studies

## S (Statement) - 输出陈述
Produce a bilingual (English-Chinese) technical document with:
- Clear hierarchical structure with numbered sections
- Detailed explanations of each SDLC model with diagrams/descriptions
- Comparison tables highlighting differences between models
- Phase-by-phase breakdown with objectives, activities, and deliverables
- Practical guidelines for model selection
- Industry best practices and anti-patterns
- Examples from enterprise and exam contexts
- Format: Markdown with proper headings, lists, tables, and code blocks where applicable

## P (Personality) - 风格个性
Writing style:
- **Technical precision**: Use accurate terminology and definitions
- **Educational clarity**: Explain complex concepts in accessible language
- **Structured presentation**: Organize content logically with clear hierarchies
- **Bilingual balance**: Maintain consistency between English and Chinese versions
- **Practical orientation**: Include actionable insights and real-world applications
- **Examination focus**: Align with software engineering certification requirements
- **Professional tone**: Formal yet engaging, suitable for technical documentation

## E (Experiment) - 实验扩展
Consider these advanced dimensions:
1. **Hybrid models**: Combine traditional and Agile approaches (e.g., Water-Scrum-Fall)
2. **Industry-specific adaptations**: Healthcare, finance, embedded systems
3. **Scale considerations**: Small teams vs. enterprise-level implementations
4. **Tool ecosystems**: JIRA, Azure DevOps, GitHub integration
5. **Metrics and KPIs**: How to measure SDLC effectiveness
6. **Risk management**: Identifying and mitigating risks in each phase
7. **Compliance requirements**: SOC 2, ISO standards, regulatory considerations
8. **Future trends**: AI-assisted development, low-code/no-code impact on SDLC
